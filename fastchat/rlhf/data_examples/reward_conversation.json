The plant is native to South America, but it is still widely grown as a garden flower.  Sweet peas do not like a hot climate, so they might not be appropriate in your area.

One alternative to shampoo is a clarifying conditioner that can help remove sebum and excess hair buildup, which can both cause curly hair to “tangle” more easily.  The same goes for shaving curly hair.  Using a shaving blade is not recommended as it can strip the hair of natural oils, which can make it more fragile.  A safer alternative is to use a disposable razor.  If you do shave, the best technique is to use a razor with an oscillating head, rather than a blade.  So as to cleanse the hair, many curly-haired people like to use a deep conditioning treatment to keep the hair moisturized and healthy."

This could happen for a few reasons, one is because hair breakage is mostly just a result of the inherent “toughness” of the hair.  Another reason is that curly hair is more fragile because it’s “thinner”, or more closely packed together.  Some factors can increase the chances of breakage.  The most common factor, from what I’ve read, is tying the hair in a tight ponytail, such as when doing sports, etc.  The small tight knots can cut into the hair, causing breakage.  Also, curlers and other heat-based styling tools can cause damage to the hair.  For maintenance, it’s important to use heat-protective products when styling curly hair.  Tousling is a good way to style curly hair, which will also help keep the hair from breaking off."

A strand is like a rope, with a wide part at the bottom (the “root”) and a thinner and narrower part at the top (the “tip”).  Hair strands generally remain firmly attached to the follicle, and are continuously growing, until they reach a length where they are unable to attach to the follicle anymore.  At this point the hair begins to break from the root, and you often see the hair loosen and separate a bit at the ends.  This happens to most people at different lengths depending on the type of hair and the genetics of the person.  Hair can be very weak at the base, so this is often the most fragile part of the strand.  \n\nThis is also why many people choose to use heat styling tools to straighten and relax their hair.  One drawback of straightening hair is that it can weak"

Some cats prefer to have their head combed, while others prefer their body.\n\n- 3. For small to medium sized cats, a natural bristle brush should work fine.  A boar-bristle brush may be better for long hair.\n\n- 4. Don’t use the same brush for more than one cat, as they may carry parasites from other cats."
